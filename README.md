We provide the code and data used for the simulations described in [arXiv:2504.12472]. 
Itdvp_GD.jl contains the core functions for the iTDVP algorithm, which are called by other scripts.
MPS_Gradient_Descent.jl implements the algorithm for finding periodic orbits using the MPS tangent space, as detailed in [arXiv:2504.12472].
MPS_trajectories.ipynb loads and analyzes the properties of the computed trajectories.
The accompanying ZIP archive includes files containing the initial points of the trajectories and data for figures.
